## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


Hi, my name is Belynda Herrera. Iâ€™m a masterâ€™s student at UC San Diego ðŸŒŠ, studying Computational Social Science. There are many avenues within CSS, and my approach focuses on using data to reveal patterns in our society. During my undergraduate studies, I majored in Political Science - Data Analytics and Sociology.

Some fun facts about me: In high school, I raised farm animals. I went to undergrad at UC San Diego as a transfer student. In my free time, I enjoy going to the beach, hanging out with friends, traveling, and listening to podcasts.
